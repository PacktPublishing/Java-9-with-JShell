# Java 9 with JShell

This is the code repository for [Java 9 with JShell](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/java-9-jshell?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787282841), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Java 9 has come out with several fantastic features including significant performance improvements, making it faster than ever. This book will teach you to organize data in an efficient way while exploiting the new features of Java 9 data structures. We will also cover classical, functional, and reactive data structures, giving you the ability to understand computational complexity, solve problems, and write efficient code.

We start off with the basics of algorithms and data structures, helping you understand the fundamentals and measure complexity. From here, we introduce you to concepts such as arrays, linked lists, as well as abstract data types such as stacks and queues. Next, weâ€™ll take you through the basics of functional programming while making sure you get used to thinking in recursion.

We provide plenty of examples along the way to help you understand each concept. You will get the also get a clear picture of reactive programming, binary searches, sorting, search trees, undirected graphs, and a whole lot more.

## Instructions and Navigation

All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
double getGeneratedRectangleHeight() {
    final Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(37, 87);
    return rectangle.height; 
}

```

A computer with a dual-core CPU and at least 4 GB RAM, capable of running JDK 9 Windows Vista SP2, Windows 7, Windows 8.x, Windows 10 or higher, macOS 10.9 or higher. Any Linux distribution supported by JDK 9. Any IoT device capable of running JDK 9 will also be useful.
